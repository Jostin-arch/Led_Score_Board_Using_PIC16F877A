# Led_Score_Board_Using_PIC16F877A
This is a hardware prototype of a digital scoreboard and timer built on a solderless breadboard.  The core of the project is a PIC16F877A microcontroller, which controls all the peripherals. It features a dual-display system: a 4-digit 7-segment display for showing primary data like score or time, and a 16x2 character LCD for displaying status messages or team names. User input is handled by several push buttons, and an HC-05 Bluetooth module is included for wireless communication or configuration. The image shows the fully wired and operational circuit, with the 7-segment display showing a time of "20:25".
